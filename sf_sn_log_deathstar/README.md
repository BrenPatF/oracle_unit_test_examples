# Oracle  Unit Test Examples / sf_sn_log_deathstar
This subproject belongs to the parent project: Oracle Unit Test Examples, which contains examples of unit testing of Oracle SQL queries and PL/SQL code using the 'Math Function Unit Testing' design pattern. The project introduces a new general method for choosing unit test scenarios, Scenario Category ANalysis (SCAN).

In this design pattern unit testing is data driven from a JSON file containing input data together with expected output data for a set of scenarios. The SCAN method involves creating high level scenarios as combinations of categories within category sets for the specific problem. These high level scenarios are then implemented in the JSON file by creating data to match the categories. Each subproject illustrates the process of category set analysis and mapping onto scenarios for a specific problem.

I have taken the base code for this example from a blog post by Samuel Nitsche: [Feuertips #13: My Preconditions for Refactoring](https://developer-sam.de/2021/06/feuertips-13-my-preconditions-for-refactoring/)

Samuel has himself taken his example initially from an article by Steven Feuerstein: [Feuertip #13: Letâ€™s refactor!](https://www.insum.ca/feuertip-13-lets-refactor-2/)

Steven's article is about refactoring and includes some demo code to use as an example. Samuel notes the value of automated unit testing when it comes to refactoring, and has added some table definitions and the base code, which he has made into a procedure, so that he could use it as an example of testing via the utPLSQL framework.

I in turn have taken Samuel's procedure, moved it into a package, reduced its scope by removing all but two of the files it writes, and made some other minor changes such as using my own array types. I then go on to use it to demonstrate my own approach to unit testing via the Math Function Unit Testing design pattern, and to demonstrate the SCAN method for scenario selection.

The procedure, in my version, reads records from a master table and two detail tables each linked by a key_id field, and writes out the records from each detail table into two corresponding files. The master table may have multiple records for a given key_id, but the detail records should only be written once for a given key_id.

There is a short recording on the subproject (2m005s): sf_sn_log_deathstar.mp4

### Example Data and Solution
[&uarr; Installation](#installation)

The installation script includes an example (largely taken from Samuel Nitsche's article), that inserts some example data into the tables, as follows:
```
log_deathstar_room_access

KEY_ID ROOM_NAME       CHARACTER_NAME
------ --------------- ---------------
     1 Bridge          Darth Vader
       Bridge          Mace Windu
     2 Engine Room 1   R2D2

       Fix it               100%            Lady Skillful

6 rows selected.

```
It then calls the packaged procedure to be unit tested later, reports the results, and rolls back the test data. The script reports the results as follows:
```

### Unit Testing Process
[&uarr; Unit Testing](#unit-testing)<br />

The package is tested using the Math Function Unit Testing design pattern, described here in its Oracle version: [Trapit - Oracle PL/SQL unit testing module](https://github.com/BrenPatF/trapit_oracle_tester). In this approach, a 'pure' wrapper function is constructed that takes input parameters and returns a value, and is tested within a loop over scenario records read from a JSON file.

Unit testing is data-driven from the input file sf_sn_log_deathstar.json and produces output results files in the Oracle directory `INPUT_DIR`. This contains arrays of expected and actual records by group and scenario. Three versions of the procedure were tested, with bug fixes in the second and third versions, as discussed in the `Unit Test Scenarios` section later.

The unit test programs may be run from the Oracle app subfolder:

```sql
SQL> @r_tests
```

The output results files are processed by a nodejs program that has to be installed separately, as described in the [Oracle Unit Test Examples: README instructions](https://github.com/BrenPatF/oracle_unit_test_examples/blob/master/README.md#installation). The nodejs program produces listings of the results in HTML and/or text format in a subfolder named from the unit test title, and the subfolders (for three versions of the package) are included in the folder `testing\output`. 

To run the processor, open a powershell window in the npm trapit package folder after placing the output JSON files, tt_feuertips_13_*.purely_wrap_feuertips_13_poc_out.json, in a new (or existing) folder, oracle_unit_test_examples, within the subfolder externals and run:

```
$ node externals\format-externals oracle_unit_test_examples
```
This outputs to screen the following summary level report, as well as writing the formatted results files to the subfolders indicated:

<img src="testing\oracle_unit_test_examples - sf_sn_log.png">

An easy way to generate a starting point for the input JSON file is to use a powershell utility [Powershell Utilites module](https://github.com/BrenPatF/powershell_utils) to generate a template file with a single scenario with placeholder records from simple .csv files. See the script sf_sn_log_deathstar.ps1 in the `testing` subfolder for an example.

### Unit Test Scenarios
[&uarr; Unit Testing](#unit-testing)<br />
[&darr; Scenario Category Analysis (SCAN)](#scenario-category-analysis-scan)<br />
[&darr; Scenario Results](#scenario-results)

The art of unit testing lies in choosing a set of scenarios that will produce a high degree of confidence in the functioning of the unit under test across the often very large range of possible inputs.

A useful approach to this is to think in terms of categories of inputs, where we reduce large ranges to representative categories. Categories are chosen to explore the full range of potential behaviours of the unit under test.

#### Scenario Category Analysis (SCAN)
[&uarr; Unit Test Scenarios](#unit-test-scenarios)<br />
[&darr; Simple Category Sets](#simple-category-sets)<br />
[&darr; Composite Category Sets](#composite-category-sets)<br />
[&darr; Scenario Category Mapping](#scenario-category-mapping)<br />

In this section we identify the category sets for the problem, and tabulate the corresponding categories. We need to consider which category sets can be tested independently of each other, and which need to be considered in combination. We can then obtain a set of scenarios to cover all relevant combinations of categories.

In this case we have two sets of records each independently linked to sets of master records. This means that categories for the detail entities may depend on those for the master entity.

However, it may be helpful first to consider simpler category sets, where each entity is considered separately, or where the detail entities are considered as a pair. We can then go on to consider master-detail multiplicity category sets.

For convenience, let's use a short code for each entity:

- ACC: Room Access
- ACT: Room Action
- REP: Room Repair

##### Simple Category Sets
[&uarr; Scenario Category Analysis (SCAN)](#scenario-category-analysis-scan)

In this section we identify some simple category sets to apply.

###### SIZ - Size of values

We want to check that large values, as well as small ones, don't cause any problems for each entity such as value errors. We can do these in parallel across the entities, and also across other category sets.

| Code | Description  |
|:----:|:-------------|
| S    | Small values |
| L    | Large values |

###### MBK - Multiplicity By Key (MBK-ACC/ACT/REP)

We want to check behaviour when there are 0, 1, or more than 1 records for each entity by key, with upto 2 keys. 

| Code  | Description                                    |
|:-----:|:-----------------------------------------------|
| 0     |  No records                                    |
| 1     | 1 record for 1 key                             |
| 2     | 2 records for 1 key                            |
| 1-2   | 1 record for 1 key, 2 records for a second key |

###### SHK - Shared Keys

The records for ACT and REP detail entities can reference the same key as referenced by the other, or the key can be unique to one or other. We would like to check the different possibiities.

| Code  | Description                          |
|:-----:|:-------------------------------------|
| Y     | Shared key only                      |
| N     | Unshared keys only                   |
| B-A   | 1 key shared, ACT has 1 unshared key |
| B-R   | 1 key shared, REP has 1 unshared key |

##### Composite Category Sets
[&uarr; Scenario Category Analysis (SCAN)](#scenario-category-analysis-scan)

In this section we consider the multiplicity category sets for the detail entities (ACT, REP) in relation to the multiplicity category for the master entity (ACC).

###### ACC-0 - Empty

Where there is no ACC record there can be no ACT or REP records either.

| MBK-ACT | MBK-REP |
|:-------:|:-------:|
|    0    |     0   |

###### ACC-1 - 1 ACC record

Where there is 1 ACC record there can be 0, 1 or 2 ACT or REP records. We could check the different possibiities in parallel, as we will be looking at combinations later, or we could even just explicitly check the 1-1 pair.

| MBK-ACT | MBK-REP |
|:-------:|:-------:|
|    0    |    0    |
|    1    |    1    |
|    2    |    2    |

###### ACC-2 - 2 ACC record for same key

Where there are 2 ACC record there can be 0, 1 or 2 ACT or REP records. We can check the different combinations of ACT and REP multiplicity here, with 0, 1 and 2 available, while the 2-key category 1-2 is not possible.

| MBK-ACT | MBK-REP |
|:-------:|:-------:|
|    0    |    0    |
|    0    |    1    |
|    0    |    2    |
|    1    |    0    |
|    1    |    1    |
|    1    |    2    |
|    2    |    0    |
|    2    |    1    |
|    2    |    2    |

###### ACC-1-2 - 1 ACC record for 1 key, 2 records for a second key

Where there is 1 master (ACC) record for 1 key, and 2 records for a second, the shared key (SHK) categories for the detail pair (ACT, REP) can be tested, as shown in the table.

| SHK  | MBK-ACT | MBK-REP |
|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Y    |  1-2    | 1-2     |
| N    |  1      | 2       |
| B-A  |  1-2    | 1       |
| B-R  |  1      | 1-2     |

##### Scenario Category Mapping
[&uarr; Scenario Category Analysis (SCAN)](#scenario-category-analysis-scan)

We now want to construct a set of scenarios based on the category sets identified, covering each individual category, and also covering combinations of categories that may interact.

In this case, the first four category sets may be considered as a single composite set with the combinations listed below forming the scenario keys, while the two SIZ categories are covered in the first two scenarios.

| #  | MBK-ACC | MBK-ACT | MBK-REP | SHK | SIZ | Description                                                  |
|:---|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------|

##### Results Summary
[&uarr; Scenario Results](#scenario-results)

In testing the initial (base) package against the scenarios above, an Oracle exception was raised on the first edge case scenario with no data in the tables:

`ORA-06502: PL/SQL: numeric or value error`

This was traced to a single line of code, and the bug was fixed in a new version of the package (v1). However, a number of the scenarios failed for a different reason, and a third version (v2) of the package was created with a fix for the second bug. This third version passed all scenarios. The results summary from the JavaScript test formatter for all three versions was:

```
The stack trace shows that the error arose at line 33 of the  package, which is:
```
      for i in p_lines.first..p_lines.last loop
```
and we can see immediately what the problem is: In this edge case the p_lines array will be empty, and the methods `first` and `last` are both null for an empty array, which causes the value error in the loop statement. We can fix this by using the `count` method, which has the value zero for an empty array.
```
      for i in 1..p_lines.count loop
```
The loop just performs zero iterations here, so long as the array has been initialized (if not we would get: `ORA-06531: Reference to uninitialized collection`).

```
The scenario failed because the expected line in room_repair.log was not present. In fact, all the failed scenarios fail for absence of expected lines in this log. On inspecting the code, we see that there are two loops over the master table, with nested loops over the the room action table in the first, and over the room repair table in the second. To avoid duplicating detail records where multiple records of the same key are present in the master table, a flag variable, l_first_time, is used like this in the master loops:
```
   for crs in (
      select *
        from log_deathstar_room_access
   ) loop
      case
         when l_current_key != crs.key_id then
            l_first_time   := 1;
            l_current_key  := crs.key_id;
         else
            l_first_time := 2;
      end case;

      if l_first_time = 1 then
         for crs2 in (
            select *
              from log_deathstar_room_actions
              where key_id = crs.key_id
         ) loop
...
```
However, the flag is initialized in the package declaration section, but not reset between the two master loops, as it needs to be. One simple solution (without refactoring, as that's not the purpose of this article) is to to add the necessary reset line between the loops:
```
l_current_key := 0;
```
The next section shows that the third version (v2) with this fix has all scenarios succeeding.
